AutoScaling Groups:
===================
ASG is used to scale up and scale down instances based on certian metrics.

Example: If cpu utilization is more than 70 for 5 mins then new instances will be launched using ASG.

Scaling Options:
================
1) vertical Scaling
We add more power to existing instances.
t2.micro --> t2.medium

2) Horizontal scaling
Add more instances to the environment.
if we have 1 ec2 instance then it will add 1 new ec2 instance.

ASG will work based on launch configuration and launch template.

We have 3 types os states in ASG.

Minimum : 1
Desired : 2
maximum : 5

Desired should be always greater than minimum.

Launch Template and launch Configurations:
==========================================

Both launch template and launch configurations are similar.

Launc template support multiple versions of templates.
We can edit or override some parametes in launch template and it is recomended by aws.

Launch configurations are not edited and if we want to update any thing then
we need to create new launch configuration again.
Not recomended by aws.
